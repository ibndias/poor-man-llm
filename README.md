# poor-man-llm
Simple, straight forward low-cost LLM Fine Tuning

The collection of latest bleeding edge poor man's LLM fine tuning which can be done freely on Google Collab or others.

Also will provide a simple guide to run.

For now we provide 7B Fine tune and how to run locally using consumer GPU.

Any contributions are welcome! :)
